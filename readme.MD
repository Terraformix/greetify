### üîπ Azure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

- Provisioned a private AKS cluster, Azure Container Registry (ACR), and SQL Server, securing them with private endpoints and VNet peering to ensure isolated communication.
- Managed Azure RBAC roles and leveraged Managed Identities for secretless authentication.
- Deployed a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on a private VM, secured via Azure Bastion for SSH access, avoiding public exposure.
- Configured Azure Application Gateway as an ingress controller for secure traffic routing to AKS.
- Used Private DNS Zones to enable seamless name resolution across services in different Virtual Networks.

### üîπ Lightweight cluster setup on Ubuntu using K3s

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** ‚Äì Set up a K3s cluster on an Ubuntu VM to host my application.
- **Implemented MetalLB** ‚Äì Configured MetalLB as a load balancer to manage external traffic for services running in the K3s cluster.

---

### üîπ GitOps & CI/CD Automation

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Built pipelines for deploying apps to an AKS Cluster, using both cloud-hosted and self-hosted runners for optimized performance.
- **ArgoCD for GitOps**: Implemented ArgoCD for GitOps, ensuring all deployments are version-controlled and automatically applied to the cluster to avoid manual operations changing the state of the cluster.

### üîπ Service Mesh

- **Istio Service Mesh**: Secured pod-to-pod communication with mutual TLS (mTLS), implemented traffic splitting between two versions of my app, and used Istio VirtualServices to simulate canary deployments.

### üîπ DevSecOps

- Secured Kubernetes workloads using Istio Service Mesh, enforcing mutual TLS (mTLS) for encrypted pod-to-pod communication.
- Automated vulnerability scanning with Trivy to detect security issues in base Docker images.
- Enforced Kubernetes security best practices by scanning static manifest files with Kube-sec, identifying misconfigurations before deployment.
- Hardened cluster components using Kube-bench to assess compliance with Kubernetes Security Benchmarks, mitigating potential risks.

---

### üîπ Ansible

- Made use of basic Ansible playbooks to configure Virtual machines after provisioning.

---

### üîπ Monitoring, Alerting and Observability

- Deployed a Prometheus operator using Helm and made use of Custom Resources to set up monitoring, alerting and visualization within the cluster.
- Created custom prometheus metrics and exposed an API endpoint for Prometheus to pull application metrics from in real-time.
- Created Prometheus Rules (Recording rules and Alert rules) to store basic pre-computed queries and send real-time notifications on metrics to Slack.

### üîπ Docker compose

- Configured a Docker Compose file to define and manage all required services, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.

---

### üîπ Scripting & Automation

- Developed Bash scripts to automate Helm chart installations, run scans on Docker images and Static configuration files, and test Istio Virtual Service traffic splitting capabilities.

- Provisioning Cloud infrastructure seamlessly using Terraform
- Building CI/CD pipelines and deploying workloads to a Kubernetes Cluster
- Application monitoring, metric visualization and much more

## üìö Future Addons / Improvements I'd like to make

- Implement Hashicorp Vault to securely store secrets
- Utilizing different ArgoCD Deployment patterns such as the App of Apps pattern and Multi-Cluster pattern.
- Recreating the existing Terraform code to spin up Infrastructure in other public clouds such as AWS.
