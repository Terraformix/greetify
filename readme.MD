# üåç Greetify: Multilingual Greetings Management Application

> üöÄ A Full-Stack Application demonstrating modern cloud and DevOps principles.

## üìù Project Overview

Greetify is an end-to-end web application designed to view and manage greetings across various languages, serving as a practical showcase of my growing expertise in DevOps/DevSecOps and Cloud technologies.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Backends (Basic microservices)**: Node.js, C# .NET Core
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD
- **Cloud services**: Azure Kubernetes (AKS), Azure Container Registry, Key Vault, Application Gateway, Log Analytics Workspace, Azure SQL Server, IAM roles
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Azure Kubernetes Service and K3s)
- **Monitoring & Visualization**: Prometheus & Grafana
- **Service Mesh**: Istio

## üîç Key Highlights

### üîπ Kubernetes

- **Helm for Dynamic Manifests**: Built reusable Helm charts for deploying Kubernetes workloads, enabling easy configuration across environments.
- **StatefulSets for SQL Server**: Ensured data persistence and stable network identities for SQL Server instances in Kubernetes.
- **Network Security**: Enforced Kubernetes Network Policies to control ingress/egress traffic.
- **RBAC & Service Accounts**: Restricted pod permissions with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and dedicated service accounts.
- **Health Probes**: Configured readiness/liveness probes for reliable app availability.

### üîπ Azure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

- Provisioned a private AKS cluster, Azure Container Registry (ACR), and SQL Server, securing them with private endpoints and VNet peering to ensure isolated communication.
- Managed Azure RBAC roles and leveraged Managed Identities for secretless authentication.
- Deployed a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on a private VM, secured via Azure Bastion for SSH access, avoiding public exposure.
- Configured Azure Application Gateway as an ingress controller for secure traffic routing to AKS.
- Used Private DNS Zones to enable seamless name resolution across services in different Virtual Networks.

### üîπ Lightweight cluster setup on Ubuntu using K3s

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** ‚Äì Set up a K3s cluster on an Ubuntu VM to host my application.
- **Implemented MetalLB** ‚Äì Configured MetalLB as a load balancer to manage external traffic for services running in the K3s cluster.


### üîπ GitOps & CI/CD Automation

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Built pipelines for deploying apps to an AKS Cluster, using both cloud-hosted and self-hosted runners for optimized performance.
- **ArgoCD for GitOps**: Implemented ArgoCD for GitOps, ensuring all deployments are version-controlled and automatically applied to the cluster to avoid manual operations changing the state of the cluster.

### üîπ Service Mesh

- **Istio Service Mesh**: Secured pod-to-pod communication with mutual TLS (mTLS), implemented traffic splitting between two versions of my app, and used Istio VirtualServices to simulate canary deployments.

### üîπ DevSecOps

- Secured Kubernetes workloads using Istio Service Mesh, enforcing mutual TLS (mTLS) for encrypted pod-to-pod communication.
- Automated vulnerability scanning with Trivy to detect security issues in base Docker images.
- Enforced Kubernetes security best practices by scanning static manifest files with Kube-sec, identifying misconfigurations before deployment.
- Hardened cluster components using Kube-bench to assess compliance with Kubernetes Security Benchmarks, mitigating potential risks.

### üîπ Monitoring, Alerting and Observability

- Deployed a Prometheus operator using Helm and made use of Custom Resources to set up monitoring, alerting and visualization within the cluster.
- Created custom prometheus metrics and exposed an API endpoint for Prometheus to pull application metrics from in real-time.
- Created Prometheus Rules (Recording rules and Alert rules) to store basic pre-computed queries and send real-time notifications on metrics to Slack.

### üîπ Docker compose

- Configured a Docker Compose file to define and manage all required services, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.


### üîπ Scripting & Automation

- Developed Bash scripts to automate Helm chart installations, run scans on Docker images and Static configuration files, and test Istio Virtual Service traffic splitting capabilities.

## üîê Why This Project Matters

This project was an opportunity to apply enterprise-level DevOps practices. I gained hands-on experience with:

- Cloud-native tools like Azure, Kubernetes, and Helm
- Secure infrastructure design with RBAC, Network Policies, and OPA enforcement
- Building reliable pipelines and deploying production-ready workloads
